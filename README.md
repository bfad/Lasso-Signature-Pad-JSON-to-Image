sig_jsonToImage
===============

The sig_jsonToImage method is a Lasso wrapper for taking the JSON output of
[Signature Pad](http://thomasjbradley.ca/lab/signature-pad/) and creating an
image.


Prerequisites
-------------
- ImageMagick must be installed with the "convert" utility
- Currently only works on OS X and Linux


Installation
------------

You can download the sig_jsonToImage.inc file into the LassoStartup folder of
your Lasso 9 home directory. Feel free to compile it and stick it in
LassoLibraries if you would prefer.


Usage
-----

The code itself is well documented and has very nice comments explaining the
various options for the method.
